    <h1>Privacy Policy ‚Äì Gothrone</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Gothrone (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe App‚Äù) handles information when you use the app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our app works.</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>Gothrone connects to the Pinterest API to automate posting of affiliate product images, descriptions, and links to your Pinterest boards. It helps schedule and organize Pinterest content for marketing purposes and is intended for personal and business Pinterest management only.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The app does not collect or store personal data from users. The only data processed comes from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pinterest API (board names, pins, posting actions)</li>
      <li>Affiliate product links provided by the user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not store, share, or sell any personal or business information.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Information accessed through the Pinterest API is solely used to create and publish pins. We do not track, log, or analyze user activity outside of Pinterest‚Äôs own analytics.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Gothrone uses the official Pinterest API for all interactions. Affiliate product data may come from third-party e-commerce websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those services and recommend reviewing their policies.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We do not store sensitive user information. Pinterest authentication is handled securely through OAuth, ensuring your account credentials remain protected.</p>
